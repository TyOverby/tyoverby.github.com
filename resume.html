<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>
    All of these projects are done on my own time completely unrelated to
    any school work. The projects hosted on <a href=
    "https://github.com/TyOverby">my github page</a> date back 2 years; they
    are mostly unfinished, and some are in a state of disrepair. The ones
    listed below are the projects that I am most proud of.

<h2>Education</h2>

education took off when Udacity and Coursera launched, offering free online
classes. I am currently a computer science major at the University of
Washington Seattle.</p>
