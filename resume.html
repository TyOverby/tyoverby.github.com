All of these projects are done on my own time completely unrelated to any school work. The projects hosted on <a href="https://github.com/TyOverby">
my github page

 date back 2 years; they are mostly unfinished, and some are in a state of disrepair. The ones listed below are the projects that I am most proud of.

Lisp->Any
</td>
 <td>
While creating a lisp->Javascript compiler, I wound up externalizing all of the Javascript-specific parts, creating a compiler that, given a file of transformation rules, would transform any program of s-expressions into the target language specified by the rules. Currently I have written rules for Lisp->Javascript, sExpression->html, sExpression->LaTeX, though creating a new target takes a matter of minutes.

CanvaS
</td>
 <td>
The summer before my freshman year of college I took a 5 -credit image processing class at the University of Washington. My favorite part was computational image generation due to the mix of creativity and programming skills required. However, I was disapointed with the interface provided and wrote a domain specific language in Scala called CanvaS. It focuses on image generation through a functional-programming methodology; maps and filters on pixels to create interesting pictures.

DCPUtilities
</td>
 <td>
An effort to learn an assembly language led to DCPUtilities, an emulator for the DCPU, a 16 -bit CPU designed by Markus Persson. The emulator is written in Java along with a GUI and assembler. More than just writing a complex program in Java, I 've also become conscious of design decisions on the processor level.

Ants AI
</td>
 <td>
Created to compete in the Google AI challenge, the competition taught me much about AI and performance critical code. My AI placed in the top 80 % of entries for the majority of the contest, however, a last minute change dropped it down to the mid-70s. The project was so engaging, that I am currently looking at creating an AI contest of my own.

OpenSpace
</td>
 <td>
Created along with three other students, OpenSpace is a 3 , networked video game in the space-shooter genre. The entire game and engine was written by hand only using bindings for OpenGL and OpenAL to handle graphics and sound. Challenges included syncing game state, creating a decent HUD/UI, and transitioning musical scores. I personally worked on the HUD and audio-programming, and also created the 3 models for the game.

Pixelmath Shim
</td>
 <td>
Created during an introductory image-processing class, Pixelmath-Shim is a layer written in Java and Python that sits in between a pre-made image processing program written by the professor of the class. It took the C-like API from the program and provided a more pythonic interface for the students to use. Where before, programmers had to keep track of their image identification number, and use it whenever they wanted to modify an image, with Pixelmath Shim, they could instantiate an object which handled id 's for them.

Orbit
</td>
 <td>
Built as a final project for a physics class, Orbit is a solar system simulator written in Javascript with HTML5 canvas. It was the first project to use a &#40; still unfinished &#41; Coffeescript game engine that handled resolution independence, loading resources, and a basic game loop. Outside of possibly serving as a screensaver, it doesn 't do that much.

Languages / Technologies

Scala
</td>
 <td>
Almost completely replacing Java once learned, Scala is my current go-to language. I find that it works very well for both large programs and small scripts, and the merge of functional and object oriented design is amazing when working with collections and unit testing.

Javascript
</td>
 <td>
Pretty much required for any web-programming, many of my personal projects that I want to show off to my friends are written in JS. After learning Lisp, much of Javascript is now clear, and my labors through callback-hell are finally over. Much of my experience with Javascript is compiled either through Coffeescript or my own Lisp->Javascript compiler.

 <h2>
Education
</h2>
 <p>
I began learning programming early in middle school, however, my education took off when Udacity and Coursera launched, offering free online classes. I am currently a computer science major at the University of Washington Seattle.
