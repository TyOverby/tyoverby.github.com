            <h1> A Rusty Microbenchmark </h1>

<div id="post">
    <p>As a totally contrived example, I will be computing the expression</p>

<p>
    $ \sum_{i=0}^{1,000,000,000} \begin{cases} i/2 + 2 &amp; \text{if } i \% 2 = 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
</p>

<p>in both C and Rust to see how close in performance Rust can get to C while still being written in
an idiomatic pure-functional style.</p>

<h1 id="rust">Rust</h1>
<p>```rust
use std::iter::range;</p>

<p>fn main() {
    let mut iterator =
      range(0i32, 1_000_000_000i32)
        .filter(|x| *x % 2 == 0)
        .map(|x| x / 2)
        .map(|x| x + 2);
    let ans = iterator.fold(0, |a, b| a + b);
    println!(“{}”, ans);
}
```</p>

<h1 id="c">C</h1>

<p>```c
#include <stdio.h></stdio.h></p>

<p>void main(void) {
    int counter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000000; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            counter += (i / 2) + 2;
        }
    }
    printf(“%d\n”, counter);
}
```</p>

<p>Both of these implementations are flawed in various ways:
1. Using 32-bit integers means that the computation overflows very quickly
2. Finding the even numbers doesn’t require a filter or if statement when you
   could only look at every other number to begin with.
3. The rust implementation should do both map steps at once.</p>

<p>These issues were kept despite their flaws:
1. To avoid slower number operations;
2. To test how well the compilers handle branching at the CPU level; and
3. To see if Rust is able to optimize away the additional map.</p>

<p>I was incredibly surprised to see that on my machine, Rust was able to
outperform C reliably.</p>

$ rustc iter.rs  –opt-level 3
$ time ./iter

$ gcc test.c -std=c99 -O3

<p>real    0m1.398s
user    0m1.388s
sys     0m0.004s
```</p>

<p>I’m sure that there are ways to get the C version faster, but the only important takeaway from this
5 second experiment is that the Rust compiler does a damn good job of providing abstractions
that hit really close to the metal.</p>
