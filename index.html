              An effort to learn an assembly language led to DCPUtilites, an emulator for the DCPU,
              a 16-bit CPU designed by Markus (Notch) Persson.  The emulator is written in Java along
              with a GUI and assembler.  More than just writing a complex program in Java, I've also
              become conscious of design decisions on the processor level.

              The Google AI challenge was one of the most fun experiences of my life. 
              It was a month-long coding challenge where a board-game was simulated 
              and played by AI written by people across the globe.  
              The AI that I wrote was in the top 80% of entries for the majority of the contest, 
              but a last minute change took it down to about 75%

              Created by along with 3 other students, OpenSpace is a 3d networked space-shooter 
              game created in Java for a class project.  The entire engine and game were written 
              entirely by hand, only using bindings for OpenGL and OpenAL.  Challenges included 
              syncing game state, creating a decent graphical representation of the game, and UI.  
              I also learned 3d modeling and texturing as needed during the project.

            <td>
              Created for an image processing course, Pixelmath-Shim was written in a mix of 
              Java and Python to sit in between a pre-made image processing program that was 
              created by the professor.  It took the C-like api provided to us, and made it 
              more pythonic.  Instead of tracking objects via an identification number, all 
              the functions would be encapsulated, with the id recorded in each object for easy use.

              Built as a final project for a physics class, Orbit is a solar system 
              simulation written in javascript with HTML5 Canvas.  Getting canvas 
              to scale across devices was a challenge that I didn't expect, so features 
              making this easier were built into my other project Coffee-Engine.  
              Outside of looking pretty and making a killer screensaver, it doesn't serve much purpose.
