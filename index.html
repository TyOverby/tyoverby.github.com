                        An effort to learn an assembly language led to DCPUtilites, an emulator for the DCPU,
                        a 16-bit CPU designed by Markus (Notch) Persson.  The emulator is written in Java along
                        with a GUI and assembler.  More than just writing a complex program in Java, I've also
                        become conscious of design decisions on the processor level.

                        and played by AI written by people across the globe.
                        The AI that I wrote was in the top 80% of entries for the majority of the contest,
                        but a last minute change took it down to about 75%

                        entirely by hand, only using bindings for OpenGL and OpenAL.  Challenges included
                        syncing game state, creating a decent graphical representation of the game, and UI.
                        I also learned 3d modeling and texturing as needed during the project.

                        created by the professor.  It took the C-like api provided to us, and made it
                        more pythonic.  Instead of tracking objects via an identification number, all
                        the functions would be encapsulated, with the id recorded in each object for easy use.

                        to scale across devices was a challenge that I didn't expect, so features
                        making this easier were built into my other project Coffee-Engine.
                        Outside of looking pretty and making a killer screensaver, it doesn't serve much purpose.

                        Although front-end development isn't my favorite place to work, sometimes the benefits of hosting

                        in Coffeescript due to the cleaner syntax and the sensible inheritance model.
