Hi, I'm Ty!

I'm a dev at Microsoft working on the [Roslyn compiler service](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).

In my free time I like [leatherworking](https://xxory.tumblr.com/) and
working on [hobby programming](https://github.com/TyOverby) projects.

Some of the things that I'm working on right now include:

* [A *fast* binary serialization scheme](https://github.com/TyOverby/bincode)
* [A scripting language built for embedding](https://github.com/TyOverby/ares-2)
* [A CAD program that uses implicit surfaces](https://github.com/TyOverby/implicit)


This static-content blog is built using the C preprocessor and a Makefile, and that doesn't
bother me at all.  Oh right; this is a blog. Here are some posts that I've written:

* [Error Handling in Rust and Go](posts/rust-vs-go.html)
* [Rust Speed](posts/rust-speed.html)
