Hi, I'm Ty!

I'm a dev at Microsoft working on the [C# and VB compilers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).

In my free time I like [leatherworking](https://xxory.tumblr.com/) and
working on [hobby programming](https://github.com/TyOverby) projects.

Some of the things that I'm working on right now include:

* [A *fast* binary encoder/decoder pair](https://github.com/TyOverby/bincode)
* [A scripting language built for embedding](https://github.com/TyOverby/ares-2)
* [A CAD program for implicit surfaces](https://github.com/TyOverby/implicit)


This static-content blog is built using a Makefile, and that doesn't bother me at all.
Speaking of blogs, here are some posts that I've written:
